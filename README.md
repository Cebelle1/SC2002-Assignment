# SC2002-Assignment 
## No Javadoc branch saves the checkpoint before adding Javadoc comments
Repository for our SC2002 OODP Assignment

Use VSCode to boot


# Setup

Use Github Desktop and clone the repository.

I think the correct way of using github is:

1. Create a branch (a copy of the main, which means the main should always be updated with the latest whenever possible)
2. Make changes
3. Create a pull request
4. Address review comments
5. Merge your pull request
6. Delete your branch

The github desktop when changing branches can be tricky so i suggest always save a copy locally before you open github desktop (either to push or pull)
